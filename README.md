The Future-Ready Guessing Engine
All the intelligence of tomorrow, none of the accuracy.
A hilarious parody of AI-powered tools that pretends to predict your future, guess your name, analyze your face, and help you make decisions—but with hilariously useless results.
🎭 Features
🔮 Future Predictor
Consult the quantum probability fields to discover your inevitable destiny:

"In the near future, you will open your fridge and forget why."
"Tomorrow, a bird will judge you silently."
"You'll start a new project and abandon it by Wednesday."

🧠 Name Guesser
Revolutionary mind-reading technology that's 100% accurate (because you literally type your name):

Advanced brainwave scanning (just type it in!)
Neural subroutine calibration
Guaranteed 100% accuracy every time

🪞 AI Mirror
Turn on your webcam for cutting-edge facial analysis:

Confidence Level: Usually around 3%
Energy Level: Perpetually low
Inner Chaos: Off the charts
Real-time observations like "You look like someone who just debugged for 6 hours"

🎲 Decision Decider
When you can't decide, our AI can't either! Choose from four categories:

🧠 Productive - "Reorganize your to-do list until you feel productive"
💤 Lazy - "Take a nap but pretend it's meditation"
💥 Chaotic - "Uninstall and reinstall your operating system for fun"
🎨 Creative - "Paint your error logs"

📤 Share Feature (Fake)
Try sharing your results with friends and receive valuable life advice.
🌙 Dark Mode Easter Egg
Because the app already knows your future is dark enough.

🤔 Why This Exists
This project is a satirical take on the current AI hype. While AI has incredible real-world applications, this playful parody reminds us that not everything needs "AI-powered" slapped on it. Sometimes the best solutions are simple, transparent, and don't pretend to be more intelligent than they are.

Stress relief - When you need to laugh at the absurdity of tech
Teaching tool - Example of clean vanilla JavaScript and CSS
